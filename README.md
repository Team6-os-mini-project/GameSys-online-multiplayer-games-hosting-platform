**Multiplayer Game Server**

This project is a C-based multiplayer game server and client application that supports five interactive games: Chess, Wordle, Snake and Ladder, Tic Tac Toe, and Rock Paper Scissors. Built using socket programming, the server handles multiple clients concurrently, matching players for two-player game sessions over a TCP connection. Key features include:

- **Games**: Turn-based implementations of Chess (with move validation), Wordle (5-letter word guessing), Snake and Ladder (with snakes and ladders mechanics), Tic Tac Toe (3x3 grid), and Rock Paper Scissors (best-of-n rounds).
- **Networking**: Server uses `select` for asynchronous I/O, supporting multiple simultaneous game sessions. Clients connect via IP and port (default: `127.0.0.1:8081`), with potential for local or internet play with port forwarding.
- **UI**: Client features a colorful console-based interface with ANSI-colored game boards and prompts. Server logs connection and game events.
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows adding new games by extending the `GameSession` structure and game logic functions.

Ideal for learning socket programming, game development, and client-server architecture. Currently supports two players per game session, with potential for multi-player extensions. Compile and run on Unix-like systems (e.g., Linux, macOS) with a C compiler.

**Usage**:
- Compile: `gcc game_server.c -o game_server` and `gcc game_client.c -o game_client`
- Run server: `./game_server`
- Run client: `./game_client` and select a game (1â€“5)

**Future Enhancements**:
- Support for multiple players in games like Snake and Ladder.
- Dynamic server IP input for clients.
- Authentication and secure communication.
